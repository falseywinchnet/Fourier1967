# Fourier 1967
Recovery of 1967 code for doing fourier analysis. 

I got my hands on this pdf in the process of a deep dig on why todays FFT code looks like it does.
But in teh final throws of it, was the message 'by the way, this other code is faster'

I'm busy with other things, but if you would like to help, on PDF-page 28 (page 16) is a function called FOUR2 that it would be interesting to extract and analyze.
Yes, the text can be copied, but thats useless as it ends up full of errors. It needs to be gone over quite carefully to have things like 0 and O's changed, and other things.

Also of interest is the function FOURT.

As we have first try on some of these, it would also be helpfull to hunt transcription errors!

*warning you might learn some fortran*

I'll take pull requests with your versions of it. 
   Borred? give it a try!
